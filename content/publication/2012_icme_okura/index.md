abstract: "This paper describes a method for acquiring full spherical high dynamic range (HDR) images with no missing areas by using two omni directional cameras mounted on the top and bottom of an unmanned airship. The full spherical HDR images are generated by combining multiple omni directional images that are captured with different shutter speeds.@The images generated are intended for uses in telepresence, augmented telepresence, and image-based lighting."


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: We resolve the scale ambiguity in multi-view 3D reconstruction with dual-pixel imaging.
