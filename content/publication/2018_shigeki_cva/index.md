abstract: "Estimation of naked human shape is essential in several applications such as virtual try-on. We propose an approach that estimates naked human 3D pose and shape, including non-skeletal shape information such as musculature and fat distribution, from a single RGB image. The proposed approach optimizes a parametric 3D human model using person silhouettes with clothing category, and statistical displacement models between clothed and naked body shapes associated with each clothing category. Experiments demonstrate that our approach estimates human shape more accurately than a prior method."


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: We develop NeuraLeaf, the first neural parametric model for 3D leaves for plant modeling and reconstruction.
