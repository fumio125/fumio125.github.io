abstract: "Biometric data collection is an important first step toward biometrics research practice, although it is a considerably laborious task, particularly for behavioral biometrics such as gait. We therefore propose an automatic gait data collection system in conjunction with an experience-based exhibition. In the exhibition, participants enjoy an attractive online demonstration of state-of-the-art video-based gait analysis comprising intuitive gait feature measurement and gait-based age estimation while we simultaneously collect their gait data along with informed consent. At the time of this publication, we are holding the exhibition in association with a science museum and have successfully collected the gait data of 47,615 subjects over 246 days, which has already exceeded the size of the largest existing gait database in the world."


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: We resolve the scale ambiguity in multi-view 3D reconstruction with dual-pixel imaging.
