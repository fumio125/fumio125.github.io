abstract: 'This study developed a virtual tourism system "beyond time and space" using augmented telepresence. Telepresence is a technique that provides a view of a remote site using immersive displays. In this paper, augmented telepresence (AT) refers to a kind of telepresence that provides a user with both a view of a remote site and related information using augmented reality (AR) techniques.'
