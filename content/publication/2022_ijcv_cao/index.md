abstract: "Recovering shape and albedo for the immense number of existing cultural heritage artifacts is challenging. Accurate 3D reconstruction systems are typically expensive and thus inaccessible to many and cheaper off-the-shelf 3D sensors often generate results of unsatisfactory quality. This paper presents a high-fidelity shape and albedo recovery method that only requires a stereo camera and a flashlight, a typical camera setup equipped in many off-the-shelf smartphones. The stereo camera allows us to infer rough shape from a pair of no-flash images, and a flash image is further captured for shape refinement based on our flash/no-flash image formation model. We verify the effectiveness of our method on real-world artifacts in indoor and outdoor conditions using smartphones with different camera/flashlight configurations. Comparison results demonstrate that our stereoscopic flash and no-flash photography benefits the high-fidelity shape and albedo recovery on a smartphone. Using our method, people can immediately turn their phones into high-fidelity 3D scanners, facilitating the digitization of cultural heritage artifacts."
