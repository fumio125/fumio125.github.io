abstract: "We consider the problem of estimating surface normals of a scene with spatially varying, general bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs) observed by a static camera under varying distant illuminations. Unlike previous approaches that rely on continuous optimization of surface normals, we cast the problem as a discrete search problem over a set of finely discretized surface normals. In this setting, we show that the expensive processes can be precomputed in a scene-independent manner, resulting in accelerated inference. We discuss two variants of our discrete search photometric stereo (DSPS), one working with continuous linear combinations of BRDF bases and the other working with discrete BRDFs sampled from a BRDF space. Experiments show that DSPS has comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art exemplar-based photometric stereo methods while achieving 10â€“100x acceleration."
