abstract: "This study is concerned with a large-scale telepresence system based on remote control of mobile robot or aerial vehicle. The proposed system provides a user with not only view of remote site but also related information by AR technique. Such systems are referred to as augmented telepresence in this paper. Aerial imagery can capture a wider area at once than image capturing from the ground. However, it is difficult for a user to change position and direction of viewpoint freely because of the difficulty in remote control and limitation of hardware. To overcome these problems, the proposed system uses an autopilot airship to support changing user's viewpoint and employs an omni-directional camera for changing viewing direction easily. This paper describes hardware configuration for aerial imagery, an approach for overlaying virtual objects, and automatic control of the airship, as well as experimental results using a prototype system."
