abstract: "The performance of dual task, simultaneously performing two tasks, is a useful measure of a person's cognitive abilities because it creates a heavier load on the brain than single tasks. Large-scale datasets of dual-task behavior are required to quantitatively analyze the relationships among dual-task performance, cognitive functions, and personal attributes such as age. We present an automatic data collection system for dual-task behavior that can be installed in public spaces without an operator in attendance. The system is designed as an entertainment kiosk to attract participants. We used the system to collect a large-scale dataset consisting of more than 70,000 sessions of dual-task behavior, in conjunction with a long-running exhibition in a science museum. The resultant dataset, which includes sensor data such as RGB-D image sequences, can be used for learning- and vision-based investigations of human cognitive functions."
