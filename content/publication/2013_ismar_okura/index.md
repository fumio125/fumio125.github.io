abstract: "Exploration of the real world by flying in its virtual simulation is one of the most important applications of augmented virtuality (AV) due to the popularization of Virtual Globe applications [1] (e.g., Google Earth) as well as large-scale three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction approaches. To improve the appearance of the automatically constructed 3D models, free-viewpoint (sometimes referred to as novel- or arbitrary-viewpoint) image generation using a hybrid of image- and model-based rendering [2] provides promising solutions. In some applications that allow interactive virtual exploration of the real world, virtual objects can be superimposed for visualization of disaster areas or non-existent buildings [5]. In such applications, the virtual objects have to be rendered frame-by-frame. Real-time rendering approaches have been studied for photometric registration of augmented reality (AR) [3] and have become one of the most important research fields in MR. The goal of these research has always been to achieve the same quality as offline rendering using high-quality global illumination (GI), but it has not been achieved thus far."
