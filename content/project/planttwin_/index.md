The ultimate goal of this research is the complete virtualization of plants from sensing data, i.e., the generation of a plant digital twin. This research focuses particularly on technical elements related to computer vision, and reproduces not only the shape of the plant from a set of images taken of the plant, but also its branch and leaf structure, time-series changes, etc., including occluded areas. The virtualized plant model enables simulation and mapping to genes, and is a powerful tool for automating cultivation and accelerating breeding.

This project is in progress under the following JST grants:
- 2021/04-2028/03 JST FOREST "PlantTwin: Reconstructing plants for breeding and cultivation"
- 2017/10-2021/09 JST PRESTO "Three-dimensional plant structure modeling and lifelog generation for growth analysis and prediction in future cultivation"
