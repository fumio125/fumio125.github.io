This research aims to establish "innovative photogrammetry based on a data-driven approach and co-design of imaging systems" for the purpose of faithful 3D digitization of real-world objects using cameras, and to realize a world where anyone can easily create high-quality 3D digital content. In this project, we will develop technologies to obtain not only the rough objects' shape (macro shape) but also the visible micro shape of the object surface (meso shape), which is essential for faithful digital reproduction and a finer shape that expresses reflectance (micro shape). In addition, this research will establish a technology for easily digitizing real-world objects in three dimensions using simple photographic equipment through the cooperative design of data-driven and imaging systems.

This project is in progress under the following JSPS grants:
- 2023/04-2028/03 JSPS KAKENHI (S) "Photogrammetry through co-design of data-driven 3D estimation and imaging systems"
